# DIT-IDIT-chip-design


### Introduction
this repository contains the 5th Sem project of the for the subject Digital System Design
the project is a design of a DIT chip which performs Fast fourier transform on the given data

the repo is divided into three subsections 
	-> Design Data
	-> Floor Planning info
	-> Screenshots


-> Design Data contains the design files which includes the design modules, the testbenches for the same and the constraints data

-> Floor Planning info contains the netlist files along with reports on various kinds of analysis
	this folder also contains the floor planning and physical design files along with the layout

-> screenshots contains a summarised version of the outputs which are visible on the graphical user interface of the tools being used throughout the project

### Tools used
the following are the tools used in this project along with a short brief on the aspects they were used for 

* Xilinx Vivado : designing the project and simulation
* Cadence NCsim : simulation of the project 
* Incisive metrics centre : Code coverage 
* Innovus : physical design
* Genus : synthesis and reporting statistics

### Specifications provided for the DIT-IDIT chip
